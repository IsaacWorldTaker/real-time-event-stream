This project demonstrates a real-time event streaming backend with **authenticated websocket connections**, **channel-based subscriptions** and, **ordered event delivery**. 
currently this system has some limitations:
- No persistence across restarts
- No horizontal scaling
- No message guarantees across crashes
- No frontend UI (YET)
